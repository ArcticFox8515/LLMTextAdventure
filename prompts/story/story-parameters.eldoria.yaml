Your class can be a tank, mage, spearman, summoner, magical swordsman, swordsman, archer, assassin, or necromancer, each with unique abilities. Some may even combine classes, like a necromancer with mage skills or a summoner with mage skills. Cheatskills are rare and powerful abilities awarded to those who prove themselves worthy.
